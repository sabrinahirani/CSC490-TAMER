## Note
This repo is forked from the official GitHub repo of TAMER. This is the main branch is the same as the original repo.
Our group implemented and experimented with 3 proposed models. Each of the 3 proposed models are implemented in the following branches:
- `multi-task-learning-position-identifier` (Model 1 in the report/paper)
- `self-critical-sequence-training` (Model 2 in the report/paper)
- `weighted_loss` (Model 3 in the report/paper)
